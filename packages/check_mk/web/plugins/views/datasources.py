##################################################################################
# Data sources
##################################################################################
# title: Used as display-string for the datasource in multisite (e.g. view editor)
#
# table: Might be a string which refers to a livestatus table or a function
#        which is called instead of the livestatus function query_data().
#
# infos: A key to be used to create groups out of single painters and filters.
#        e.g. 'host' groups all painters and filters which begin with "host_".
#        Out of this declaration multisite knows which filters or painters are
#        available for the single datasources.
#
# merge_by:
#  1. Results in fetching these columns from the datasource.
#  2. Rows from different sites are merged together. For example members
#     of hostgroups which exist on different sites are merged together to
#     show the user one big hostgroup.
#
# add_columns: list of columns the datasource is known to add itself
#
# add_headers: additional livestatus headers to add to each call
#
# keys: columns which must be fetched in order to execute commands on
# the items (= in order to identify the items and gather all information
# needed for constructing Nagios commands)
# those columns are always fetched from the datasource for each item
#
# idkeys: these are used to generate a key which is unique for each data row
# is used to identify an item between http requests
#
# join: A view can display e.g. host-rows and include information from e.g.
#       the service table to create a column which shows e.g. the state of one
#       service.
#       With this attibute it is configured which tables can be joined into
#       this table and by which attribute. It must be given as tuple, while
#       the first argument is the name of the table to be joined and the second
#       argument is the column in the master table (in this case hosts) which
#       is used to match the rows of the master and slave table.
#
# joinkey: Each joined column in the view can have a 4th attribute which is
#          used as value for this column to filter the datasource query
#          to get the matching row of the slave table.
#
# ignore_limit: Ignore the soft/hard query limits in view.py/query_data(). This
#               fixes stats queries on e.g. the log table.
#
# auth_domain: Querying a table might require to use another auth domain than
#              the default one (read). When this is set, the given auth domain
#              will be used while fetching the data for this datasource from
#              livestatus.
