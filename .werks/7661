Title: Fixed possible stored XSS using the internal server error handler

The internal server error handler was displaying unescaped information from the
error log of the webserver. When an attacker is able to add HTML code to error
messages written to the error log of the web server, the internal server error
handler was not escaping the HTML code when displaying it to the user.
