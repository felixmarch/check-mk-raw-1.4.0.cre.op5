When creating a new site the initial administrative user omdadmin was always initialized
with the password omd. This has been changed now.

The initial administrative user is now named <tt>cmkadmin</tt>.

The password of that user is now randomized during site initialization and written to
the console with the welcome message at the end of the creation. The password can be
changed at any time using the GUI or the htpasswd command on the command line.

If you want to specify a password during site creation, you can do this by providing
the option <tt>--admin-password</tt> together with you password as argument.
